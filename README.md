# Project X - Profit Calculation Web Application

## Overview

This project aims to build a web application that calculates the profit of items sold in a shop based on their **wholesale price** and **Maximum Retail Price (MRP)**. The system will display the **profit** made on each product and maintain a record of all products in a **PostgreSQL database**.

The web application will consist of two main components:
1. **Backend**: The backend will expose an API to handle product-related data, including the wholesale price, MRP, and profit calculations.
2. **Frontend**: The frontend will fetch data from the backend API and display the profit for each product in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Profit Calculation**: For each product, the web application calculates the profit based on the difference between the MRP and the wholesale price.
- **Database Integration**: All product data (product name, category, MRP, wholesale price, and profit) will be stored in a **PostgreSQL database**.
- **API Integration**: The backend will expose APIs that the frontend will consume to fetch product data.
- **Swagger Documentation**: The backend will be documented using **Swagger** to provide an interactive API interface for easy testing and exploration.
- **Frontend**: A web interface will display the products and their corresponding profits, allowing users to interact with the system.

## Tech Stack

### Backend Options

The backend can be implemented using two popular technologies:

1. **C# with ASP.NET Core (MVC or Web API)**:
   - **C#** is a robust, modern language with strong support for backend development. 
   - **ASP.NET Core** provides a high-performance framework for building APIs, and integrating with databases like PostgreSQL is seamless.

2. **Java with Spring Boot**:
   - **Java** is a highly scalable language commonly used for backend development.
   - **Spring Boot** offers a simplified, convention-over-configuration approach to creating microservices and APIs.
   - Spring Bootâ€™s integration with PostgreSQL can be done easily using **Spring Data JPA**.

Both of these technologies are suitable for the project. The choice between **C# and Java** depends on your team's expertise and familiarity with the respective frameworks. **Java with Spring Boot** is widely used in large-scale applications, while **C# and ASP.NET Core** may offer more streamlined tooling and support for Windows-based environments.

### Frontend

The frontend will interact with the backend API to display product data and profits. It will be built using:

- **HTML/CSS**: To structure and style the web pages.
- **JavaScript (JS)**: For dynamic functionality and API calls to the backend.
- **AJAX** or **Fetch API**: To fetch product data asynchronously from the backend.

### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database system for storing product data, including product names, categories, MRP, wholesale prices, and calculated profits.

### Documentation

- **Swagger**: To document the backend API and provide an interactive interface for API testing.

## Project Flow

1. **Backend**:
   - Set up the PostgreSQL database with the necessary tables (products, profits).
   - Implement the logic to calculate profits based on the wholesale price and MRP.
   - Expose APIs to fetch product details and profits.
   - Use Swagger to document the APIs.

2. **Frontend**:
   - Create the UI that lists products, their prices, and calculated profits.
   - Use JavaScript (AJAX or Fetch) to call the backend API and display the data.

3. **Database**:
   - Set up PostgreSQL to store product data, including name, category, MRP, wholesale price, and profit.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. **C# with ASP.NET Core**:
   - Install the latest version of **.NET Core** SDK from the official [Microsoft website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
   - Create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project.
   - Set up **Swagger** for API documentation.
   - Connect to the **PostgreSQL** database using **Entity Framework Core**.

2. **Java with Spring Boot**:
   - Install **Java JDK** and **Spring Boot**.
   - Use **Spring Data JPA** to connect to the **PostgreSQL** database.
   - Set up **Swagger** for API documentation.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - You will need a basic HTML/CSS structure and JavaScript to fetch data from the backend.

2. **Fetching Data**:
   - Use the **Fetch API** or **AJAX** to make HTTP requests to the backend API and display the data dynamically.

### Database Setup

1. **PostgreSQL**:
   - Install PostgreSQL on your machine or use a hosted database.
   - Set up the necessary tables (products, profits).

## Future Enhancements

- **Stock Management**: Add a feature to manage stock and alert when stock is low.
- **Order Management**: Automatically generate a list of products to order based on stock levels.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication for secure access to the application.

## Conclusion

This project will provide a comprehensive solution to track product profits and manage inventory in a user-friendly web application. The choice of backend technology (C# with ASP.NET Core or Java with Spring Boot) depends on your team's expertise. Both frameworks provide the necessary tools for building a scalable and efficient backend, while PostgreSQL serves as a reliable database to store product data.
